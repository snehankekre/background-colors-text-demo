# Background colors for text demo

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://background-colors-for-text.streamlit.app)

This demo showcases the markdown background color feature. 

Select a color from the dropdown and type some text to see  it rendered with the selected background color.

The markdown syntax used is `:color-background[text]`, where `color` is the name of the background color and `text` is the text to be rendered.

Supported background colors are rainbow, red, blue, green, violet, orange, and gray.

Note: You can also nest colored backgrounds with colored text, e.g. `:red-background[:blue[This is some blue text on a red background]]`.
